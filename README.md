# noise_medical_text

## Description

This project is aimed to generate noise to medical text dataset (e.g. MIMIC dataset) which are realistic enough to resemble radiologists' mistakes.

By adding noise, this new dataset with noise, can be used to train models to identify errors in medical documents.
